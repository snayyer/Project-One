          <h3><b>&nbsp; About Me</b></h3>
          <p>
		  &nbsp; I wanted to become a computer scientist since I was in grade 6th.
		  I have taken my journey towards my &nbsp; aspirations seriously. I opted for 
		  courses that would help me polish my skills before I enter Illinois Tech to 
		  &nbsp; pursue my career goals. I want to become a research scientist in the
		  field of computer science particularly &nbsp; focusing on algorithms that can
		  help shape the latest developments in technology. I have expertise in
		  basic &nbsp; programming languages such as python, java and C#. I have built
		  applications on my own to polish my skills &nbsp; and to better prepare myself
		  for the courses that will be offered at <i>Illinois Institute of Technology.</i>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  &nbsp; I plan on completing my college and pursuing a research degree to develop
		  patents and solve real world &nbsp; problems at hand. Technology now-a-days can
		  resolve many problems but it first needs to be nourished &nbsp; before it can be
		  applied in safety critical situations. My goal is to complete degree work
		  by research and &nbsp; implementation throughout the duration of my degree and to
		  start collaborating with research labs and &nbsp; helping them in developing
		  better and more efficient solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  &nbsp; I am plan to attend <i>Illinois Institute of Technology</i> because it is
		  offer me the field of study I want to &nbsp; build my career in, with some
		  personal ease and advantages. Illinois Tech is situated very near to my
		  house &nbsp; and it would be convenient for me to pursue my studies there. By
		  opting for Illinois Tech I can easily &nbsp; understand the subject I have always
		  liked and cared for with the addition to ease I can bring to my parents.
		  By &nbsp; opting Illinois Tech it will be easy for me to come home and focus on
		  my research rather than wasting &nbsp; time and money in living arrangements in
		  some other town. I will be able to properly understand the subjects &nbsp; and
		  still find time to perform research at Institute level.

		  &nbsp; I have been a chess player since 8 Grade; it has always been an interest
		  to me. My father used to teach me &nbsp; mathematics based on checkers of check
		  board teaching me how we can interpret reactions from one row &nbsp; down to one
		  column up. Besides chess I play football and badminton. It has always
		  helped me in making &nbsp; good friends through sports. It leaves a feeling of
		  trust once in you are a part of a team. It helps you feel &nbsp; better and more
		  motivated. And it teaches you how to value and respect other people
		  preferences. I have &nbsp; attended some seminars on cloud computing for my own
		  knowledge and I am an active participant in social &nbsp; services activities.
		  I believe money can help but connecting with people at a deeper level
		  is more important, I &nbsp; like to go to orphanages to talk to children there
		  and play with them. I am not a regular but I take my rounds &nbsp; every 3 months.
		  It helps me feel more important and contributing to the society. I also
		  organized a &nbsp; Keep Clean Keep Green campaign around 2 years ago. We spent
		  hours in streets educating people and gathering &nbsp; friends to help and clean
		  the environment.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  &nbsp; I believe every person in this world has a mission; it depends upon the
		  person how he/she sails the perturbed &nbsp; boat. The main purpose is to
		  understand and be reliable about situations at hand and give your best so
		  that &nbsp; whenever it comes back to you, it is the same level of best that you
		  sowed a few years ago.
